= AMRGravitySolve tester =

(Daniel R. Reynolds, June 2012)


The baseline test corresponds to the pre-existing "GravityTest"
routine, where the python answer testing script has been modified to
properly handle tests run in parallel.

To compare Enzo's existing gravity solvers against the new
AMRGravitySolve solver, it is only required that a user toggle the
value of the input parameter "SelfGravityConsistent", where the
default value of 0 corresponds with Enzo's original gravity solvers,
and a value of 1 enables AMRGravitySolve instead.

In all tests that I have run, both in serial and in parallel,
AMRGravitySolve produces results that are slightly superior
(accuracy-wise) to Enzo's FFT+MG gravity solver approach.
