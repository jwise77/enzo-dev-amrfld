= Notes on the output =

(Geoffrey So May 21, 2010)

This is a small cosmology test which requires ~16GB of disk 
space and the last data output slice should be DD0273


= General Information =
(Please refer to the parameter files for more detailed description)

-machine name: SDSC Triton
-core count: 8
-Grid: 64 cube
-LambdaCDM cosmology
-Final Redshift z = 5
-Radiation Solver = Daniel Reynolds' operator split FLD solver
-Star maker method 1, feedback method 0

The output should create non-zero values in Geoffrey's Emissivity
field once star formation occurs, and this will source the
Grey_Radiation_Energy field.  The values of the output will depend on
many factors, including but not exclusive to machine hardware (which
affects the way initial conditions are generated), compilers used to
compile Enzo, and different versions of software i.e. hypre. 


= Running =
1. First run inits.exe (from src/inits) on the file
   CosmologyFLD_RT.inits:
      inits.exe CosmologyFLD_RT.inits
2. Second run ring.exe (from src/ring) on the newly-created output
   files:
      ring.exe pv ParticlePositions ParticleVelocities
3. Run enzo.exe (from src/enzo) with the main enzo parameter file:
      enzo.exe -d CosmologyFLD_RT.enzo


= Comparing the maximum Emissivity value and its location of DD0273 =
running the included YT analysis script with python in the same
directory with Enzo to check for the maximum Emissivity field value.

= Conclusion =
The results are within 1% of each other (~0.7%), so considering the
many differences between the two versions, I'm surprised that the
result is not much more different.  As a new user of Enzo, I would
check that the value is not many of orders of magnitude off when
running this particular set of parameters on a different machine.  And
if it was ran on SDSC Triton where this test was conducted, it should
give results within ~1%.
