This test performs an i-front expansion test using the split grey FLD
solver on a static AMR hierarchy.  The source is in the center of the
domain, which is surrounded by the refined region.  We begin with a
simple 2-level grid, with a factor of 2 refinement, to ensure that the
solvers function properly.  Both grids use a 32^3 mesh, with the
subgrid centered in the inner 16^3 cells of the coarse mesh.

The test emulates Iliev et al. #1 (fixed temperature, static
hydrodynamics), in which we examine only the radiation propagation and
resulting chemical ionization (see IlievEtAl1_sp test problem).
