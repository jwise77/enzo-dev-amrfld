This test performs an i-front expansion test using the split grey FLD
solver on a dynamic AMR hierarchy.  Refinement is determined by local
spatial gradients in the opacity field
(Grid_FlagCellsToBeRefinedByOpacity).  The ionization source is in the
center of the domain, which is initially set to a coarse 16^3 spatial
grid.  As is required with the AMRsolve framework (that AMRFLD is
built on top of), refined factors use a factor of 2 refinement.

The test emulates Iliev et al. #1 (fixed temperature, static
hydrodynamics), in which we examine only the radiation propagation and
resulting chemical ionization (see RHIonization1_sp test problem).
