= AMRGravitySolve weak scaling tests =

(Daniel R. Reynolds, June 2012)


These tests use a similar setup to AMRGravityTest, but instead of
assigning a static grid with one nested level, we run with up to 3
levels of mesh refinement, using dynamic AMR that refines based on the
dark matter density.

Since Enzo's entire gravity setup requires a uniform TopGrid, we
perform two kinds of weak scaling.  When running with P processes:
* Let N3 be the largest perfect cube smaller than P, with N^3 = N3
* We allocate a BaryonField of size 32N x 32N x 32N.
* We allocate 50000 particles per process, i.e. 50000P particles.

While this is an imperfect set of weak scaling tests, it does increase
the size of the gravity problem with each perfect cube, and it
increases the severity of the gravity problem through the increasing
particle count.
